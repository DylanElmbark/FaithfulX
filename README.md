## Moving away from legacy versions

+ This pack supported 1.7 - 1.8.9 clients, however I decided to make FaithfulX compatible with new block id's which breaks support for 1.8.9 and lower. I am currently working on porting FaithfulX to 1.7 and 1.8 but it will take a while. It does work with 1.9.x all the way up to 1.15.0 snapshots.


## FAQ
+ Will this pack recieve a port to Bedrock Edition?
  + It depends if I can get it on the minecraft store, if not no...
