## Moving away from legacy versions

+ This pack supported 1.7 - 1.8.9 clients, however I decided to make FaithfulX compatible with new block id's which breaks support for 1.8.9 and lower. I am currently working on porting FaithfulX to 1.7 and 1.8 but it will take a while. It does work with 1.9.x all the way up to 1.15.1.


## FAQ
+ Does it work with 1.7 - 1.8.9?
+ This pack has issues with 1.7/1.8 since texturepack formats changed betweeen 1.8 and 1.9 but I have a fork for 1.7/1.8 on the legacy page.

+ Support for Bedrock Edition?
+ Nothing is planned right now, but I might port it over to Bedrock Edition, 64x64 might cause frame drops and other issues on Mobile devices.
